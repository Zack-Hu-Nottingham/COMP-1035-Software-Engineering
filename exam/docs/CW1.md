# The Explanation for Lab's Diagram
[[_TOC_]]



## Overall
 Our explanation has been divided into **five** parts: **Stakeholder Analysis**, **Text Analysis**, **Use Case Analysis**, **Persona** and **Clarification**.

 The **Stakeholder Analysis** is the explanation for why we choose them as stakeholders and why they are primary/secondary/tertiary stakeholders.

The **Text Analysis** contains how we identify the actors and their corresponding use case. 

 The **Use Case Analysis** is specific use cases we summarized from the article, some of which may need some modifications to be more system-like.

The **Persona** aims to figure out the background information / of the our project's main user.

The **Clarification** is our understanding for some requirements that are indistinct in meaning or indirectly stated.

## Part 2: Stakeholder Analysis
 ```
Stackholder:
 	Stakeholder is a person, an organization, or an external system that plays a role in one or more interactions with your system.
 
Primary stakeholder:
	A primary stakeholder can be direct users, to be more specific, a beneficiary or a target Beneficiaries refer to individuals who stand to gain something directly and personally. 
 
Secondary stakeholder:
	Secondary stakeholders are people who would be indirectly affected by projects, either positive or negative.
	
Tertiary stakeholder:
	This category includes people and groups who pay for the system so that they may have an influence on this system.

***In this use case diagram, there are three stakeholders:***

- 

**Primary Stakeholders:**

**Secondary Stakeholders:**

- 
  - 

Although it is not directly use the system by mentioned actions
&nbsp;

**Tertiary Stakeholders:**

## Part 4: Persona

- Persona for [normal user](../persona/normalUser.md)
- Persona for [multi-account user](../persona/multiUser.md)
- persona for [joint-account user](../persona/jointUser.md)

**Reasons**

As we are designing an app for different kinds of users for Bank of China, we get to have a clearer view of who are going to use this app, why they get to use it (the pain point for the user) and what they expect from it. And as is known to all, for users with different backgrounds and financial habits, the requirements for this app differs a lot. Also A clearer view of our persona might help our team members to draw their UML diagram. From text analysis we divided the main users into three categories according to the accounts they hold, one is normal users, one is joint-account users, the other is multi-account users. For example, 37 years old Paul Ford may pay more attention of his familyâ€™s diet, which means checking the fixed expenditure in particular area without other categories (see how much money is fixed every month for food).
