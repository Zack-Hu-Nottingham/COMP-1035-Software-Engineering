# **The Explanation for Lab's Diagram**
/*å›¾*/

## **Overall**
---
 &nbsp;

 Our explanation has been divided into three parts: Stakeholder Analysis, Use Case Analysis and Clarification.
 
 The Stakeholder Analysis is the explanation for why we choose them as stakeholders and why they are primary/secondary/tertiary stakeholders.
 
 The Use Case Analysis is specific use cases we summarized from the article, some of which may need some modifications to be more systemlike.
 
 The Clarification is our understanding for some requirements that are indistinct in meaning or indirectly stated.

## **Stakeholder Analysis**
---
&nbsp;
 ```
 **Stackholder**
 Stakeholder is a person, an organization, or an external system that plays a role in one or more interactions with your system.
 
**Primary stakeholder**
 A primary stakeholder can be direct users, to be more specific, a beneficiary or a target Beneficiaries refer to individuals who stand to gain something directly and personally. 
 
 **Secondary stakeholder**
Secondary stakeholders are people who would be indirectly affected by projects, either positive or negative.
	
**Tertiary stakeholder**
This category includes people and groups who pay for the system so that they may have an influence on this system.
