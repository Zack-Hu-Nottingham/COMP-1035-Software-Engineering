## Team Management
We split the whole project into 6 subtask: write the test script for three classes,
fix the code for three classes and add test script as well.<br>
Therefore, we set 6 milestone:  
In each milestone, we would assign different issue to each team member
and the guy who is responsible for the issue would create a new branch for that issue. Finally when all the job is done, 
one of our teammate would manage merge all these branches.
At the beginning of each milestone, we would hold a meeting. During that time, we would create issues, set a due date and assign to some people.   

Split the member into three subgroups: <br>Group1: Ziyi Wang, Zixiang Hu <br>Group2: Yicun Duan, Yingxiao Huo <br>Group3: Leshan Tan, Lin Chen: <br>
Report here, by the end of the assignment, how the team has managed the project, e.g.: used version control, organised meetings, divided work, used labels, milestones, issues, etc. etc.

## Test Plan
**You should add rows and even columns, and indeed more tables, freely as you think will improve the report.**
